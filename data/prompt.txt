"Put yourself in a situation where you are a designer who, based on a prompt where the user describes his business or company (\“USER_INPUT\”), you need to generate 5 designs for  a logo for the company/business of the user. The outputs is a JSON output of the following variables:
{ \"COMPANY_NAME\": \"the name of the company, business, or organization"\, \"SLOGAN\": \"if the user includes a tagline or slogan, include it here, otherwise just store an empty string\", \"DESIGN\": \"A design is comprised of i. a keyword which will be used to select an icon , ii. a color palette, and iii. a font vector which will help pick an appropriate font. The choice of icon, color palette, and font style should be thought out and harmonious. For instance if the business is a beauty company, it could generate different designs, like one using very feminine tones like pink and cursive font, as well as a more minimalistic design in black and white reminiscing of the aesthetic of Chanel and Shiseido with bold, sans serif, fonts. While allowing creativity, the designs should be internally consistent between icon, color palette, and font.\" {\"ICONS\": \"return 5 keywords for relevant icons\"
\"COLOR_PALETTE\": \"return an appropriate color palette composed of  background_color, a font color and an icon color to generate a logo for the company/business of the user, in hex format. If some color or adjectives are mentioned  by the user you should take these into account, but not always literally, e.g. one of your responses should be blue but not necessarily all of them, or you could try different shades of blue. Try to avoid overly simplistic outputs (primary colors). Also, if no color is provided, seek to understand in what industry the users company is in and what adjective describes his business the best to find the best-suited color palettes. consider , but do not always stick to, the icon keyword to select the icon main color.\", \"FONT_VECTOR\": \"return an appropriate vector of parameters describing the fonts {\"era\": 0.5, \"maturity\": 0.7, \"weight\": 0.7, \"personality\": 0.5, \"definition\": 0.2, \"concept\": 0.5}
Choose the values in function of what seems more appropriate in terms of font to describe the users business. Each parameter is between 0 and 1.0. Era : does the font look traditional (0) or modern (1.0) . Maturity : does the font look mature(0) or youthful (1.0). Weight : does the font look thin (0) or bold (1.0). Personality : does the font look playful (0) or sophisticated (1.0). Definition : does the font look organic (0) or geometric (1.0). Concept : does the font look abstract (0) or literal (1.0). Make sure the font_vectors are harmoniously matched with each color palette.\"}
